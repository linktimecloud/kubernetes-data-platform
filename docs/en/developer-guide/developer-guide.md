## Infrastructure layer

KDP infrastructure layer  mainly includes the OAM engine, KDP backend service stack and KDP frontend service, specifically:
* OAM engine： [KubeVela](https://kubevela.io/), [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/)
* Built-in generic components (can be replaced by existing services)：OpenEBS, PLG(Prometheus/Loki/Grafana), Kong Ingress, MySQL
* Self-developed backend services：[KDP OAM Operator](https://github.com/linktimecloud/kdp-oam-operator), [KDP Catalog Manager](https://github.com/linktimecloud/kdp-catalog-manager)
* Self-developed frontend service：[KDP UX](https://github.com/linktimecloud/kdp-ux)
* Command-line tool：KDP CLI（source codes located in the `cmd` and `pkg` directories）

The application delivery declaration of KDP infrastructure is located in the `infra` directory and the delivery format is KubeVela Addon. About KubeVela Addon development in detail, please refer to [Addons](https://kubevela.io/docs/platform-engineers/addon/intro/).

## Application layer

The application delivery declaration of KDP core components is located in the `catalog` directory, which organizes the monolithic applications under the same subsystem by the application directory. The specification of component integration can be referred to:
```

    ├── app-httpfs.cue              # httpfs-gw app model
    ├── setting-hdfs.cue            # hdfs config model
    └── setting-httpfs.cue          # httpfs-gw config model
```

## Building & Packaging
* For building packages for both infrastructure and application layer, please refer to the `Makefile` in the project root
* When buildings are finished, artifacts will be pushed to a self-hosted OCI-based registry, including images and helm charts
* When deploy KDP, you may specify to pull images and charts from a self-hosted repository, which needs to proxy both the self-hosted OCI-based registry for pushing and the KDP public repository `registry-cr.linktimecloud.com`. [Sonatype Nexus Repository](https://help.sonatype.com/en/sonatype-nexus-repository.html) is recommended for this purpose as it provides a `group` type of repository that can proxy multiple repositories.
