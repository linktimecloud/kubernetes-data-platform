### 1. Introduction
JuiceFS is a high-performance distributed file system designed for cloud-native environments, released under the Apache 2.0 open-source license. It offers comprehensive POSIX compatibility, allowing virtually all object storage to be integrated locally as massive local disks, and can also be mounted and written simultaneously across different hosts on cross-platform and cross-region environments.

### 2. Product Features

#### Multi-Protocol Access
Fully compatible with POSIX, HDFS, and S3 protocols, making it easy to develop new applications or migrate existing ones.

#### High Performance
A distributed multi-level caching mechanism provides elastic throughput capabilities and can handle data hotspot challenges; the self-developed high-performance metadata service can handle millions of requests per second with microsecond-level latency.

#### Storage for Billions of Files
Adopting a data and metadata separation architecture design, metadata storage can use open-source storage engines such as Redis and TiKV, as well as a self-developed distributed metadata service, while data storage is compatible with over 40 object storage systems, catering to various storage needs in different scenarios.

#### Cloud-Native
JuiceFS is architected for various cloud environments, including public cloud, hybrid cloud, and multi-cloud, fully leveraging the elastic scalability of cloud environments; it can also automatically replicate data across clouds and regions, helping enterprises build multi-cloud architectures.
