### 1. Application Description

JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter offering all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface.

JupyterLab can be extended using npm packages that use our public APIs. The prebuilt extensions can be distributed via PyPI, conda, and other package managers. The source extensions can be installed directly from npm (search for jupyterlab-extension) but require an additional build step. You can also find JupyterLab extensions exploring GitHub topic jupyterlab-extension. To learn more about extensions, see the user documentation.
